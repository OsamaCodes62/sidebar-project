# sidebar-project

This is a learning project. I followed a tutorial to learn how to make a sidebar. This sidebar is fully responsive, thanks to its flexible width and simple toggle mechanism. As the screen size changes, users can easily collapse or expand the sidebar to save screen space while maintaining easy access to menu items.

## Explanation:

- **`<aside>`**: This tag holds the entire sidebar.
- **`<div class="logo">`**: This section displays the logo.
- **`<nav class="menu">`**: This contains navigation links like “Home,” “Stats,” and more.
